## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question, you could do it via the chat under the issues. Contacting the maintainer directly is strictly prohibited unless deemed necessary.

#### Before Submitting a PR

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the issue that you're working on. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developer of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.

#### How Do I Submit a Good PR?

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion]
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots or screen recordings** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement/feature would be useful** to most WakeRide users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
